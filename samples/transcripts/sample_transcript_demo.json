  "questions_asked": [
    "How would you make text in a cell appear bold and increase the font size to 14? Walk me through the steps.",
    "I want to find the highest value in a column of numbers from B1 to B15. What function should I use?",
    "Explain how you would create a PivotTable to summarize sales data by region and product category. What are the key steps?",
    "Create a dynamic formula that combines INDEX and MATCH to lookup a value. Explain why this is sometimes better than VLOOKUP and provide an example.",
    "I have a table with employee names in column A and their salaries in column B. I want to look up 'John Smith' and return his salary. How would you do this using a lookup function?",
    "Calculate the total sales for the month with data in cells A1 through A10. What Excel formula would you use and why?"

    {
      "question_id": "1",
      "response": "I'd click the cell, then click the Bold button (or Ctrl+B). To increase font, use the font size dropdown in the Home tab and select 14.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "2",
      "response": "I'd use the MAX function: =MAX(B1:B15). It finds the highest value in the range.",

    },
    {
      "question_id": "3",
      "response": "First select the sales data range, go to Insert, click PivotTable. In the new sheet, drag 'Region' to Rows, 'Product Category' to Columns, and 'Sales' to Values. This summarizes sales by region and product.",

    {
      "question_id": "4",
      "response": "Use: =INDEX(C2:C10, MATCH(\"ABC\", B2:B10, 0)). INDEX/MATCH works even if the lookup value is left of the return column, unlike VLOOKUP which requires lookup to be leftmost.",

    {
